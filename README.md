# wkDLang for Worms 2
Translates the in-game text using DW2Lang language files generated by [DW2SMT](https://github.com/Dawid8plc/DW2SMT)

# Requirements
[Worms 2 Plus patch](https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus) (select English during installation)

# Download
The latest version can always be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Dawid8plc/wkDLang/releases/latest/download/wkDLang.zip)

# Usage
1. Extract both wkDLang.dll and wkDLang.ini files into your game directory
2. Open the wkDLang.ini file in your text editor of choosing
3. Set the Enabled value to 1 to enable the wormkit, and likewise to 0 when you want to disable it
4. Set the Language value to the path of the language file that you want to use, relative to the game executable, for example: MyLang.dw2lang
5. Run the game and enjoy the newly applied language!

# Example config file
```ini
[Settings]
Enabled=0
Language=MyLang.dw2lang
```

# Notes
+ Language files can be created using [DW2SMT](https://github.com/Dawid8plc/DW2SMT)
+ It is worth noting that languages that rely on special characters could require the in-game fonts to be replaced with ones that have them, by replacing or modifying the GameDir\Data\Gfx\Gfx.dir file. This is out of scope for this wormkit and it will not do anything about it. If the appropriate fonts aren't in the Gfx.dir file, the in-game text will likely be incorrect or wrong
